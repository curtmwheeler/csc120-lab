BallReach.java pseudocode:

- Declare variables
- Create Scanner object to allow input from keyboard

INPUT
 - Angle: angle at which ball is thrown
 - Speed: speed at which ball is thrown at (ms^-1)
 - Height: the initial height at which the ball is thrown

PROCESS:
 - Compute the upward velocity component (speed/gravity)
 - Compute the downward component distance height + (gravity * upward_time * upward_time) / 2
 - Compute the downward velocity component duration
 - Compute the total duration (upward duration + downward duration)
 - Compute the upward component distance (downward component distance (max height) - height)
 - Compute the y velocity component (speed * sin(angle))
 - Compute the x velocity component (speed * cos(angle))
 - compute() method orchestrates all these computations

OUTPUT:
 - Display for both Earth and Moon gravities (Earth: 9.81 ms^-2, Moon: 1.62 ms^-2)
    * Height of cliff
    * Horizontal speed
    * Initial vertical speed
